    <Paragraph>
      Are universities allowed to use race as a factor in admissions? If so, is
      Harvard University’s admissions process that factors in race violating
      Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964? Harvard University is using race
      as one of many factors in its admissions process. Students for Fair
      Admissions sued Harvard alleging that the process violates Title VI of the
      Civil Rights Act of 1964 by discriminating against Asian American
      applicants in favor of white applicants [1].
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      After a 15-day bench trial, the district court issued a detailed opinion
      in favor of Harvard. SFFA appealed, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
      First Circuit affirmed. Justices requested the government’s views on
      Harvard affirmative-action dispute [2], to which the response was that
      society is changing, and the use of race is becoming less necessary for
      universities to obtain a diverse student body. There was also a mention of
      the need for race-conscious admissions programs to have a set deadline,
      after which they have to be reviewed again.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      The Civil Rights Act of 1964 that is at question in this case is
      prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex or
      national origin. It was of significant help in integrating schools, and
      prohibiting discrimination in public places and is often called the most
      important U.S. law on civil rights since Reconstruction. It still is one
      of the most influential civil right protection acts. The Civil Rights act
      also gave power to the Department of Education (at a time Office of
      Education) to assist with school desegregation paving the way for more
      diversity in schools and fairer admissions (Title IV) [16].
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      It’s worth mentioning that Students for Fair Admissions also filed a
      similar case challenging the admissions policies at the University of
      North Carolina [13] (except it was focused more on the Fourteenth
      Amendment of the Constitution). The plaintiff argues that the University
      of North Carolina, violates the 14th Amendment’s equal protection clause,
      which bars racial discrimination by government entities, by considering
      race in its admissions process when the university does not need to do so
      to achieve a diverse student body (a claim that has been challenged by
      several expert witnesses).

    <Header>The Plaintiff's Arguments</Header>
    <Paragraph>
      Looking at the case, the plaintiff's main argument is that the rate of
      Asian students at Harvard will rise to 44% if Harvard stops factoring race
      in the admissions process. [3]. SFFA claims that Harvard created a ceiling
      for Asian Americans and thus Asian Americans who are qualified based on
      academics are discriminated against. In response, Harvard and analysts in
      the field state that increasing the share of Asian students to 44% will
      reduce diversity on campus and thus would be detrimental to the student
      body as a whole (this is called racial balancing). The current share of
      Asian students at Harvard is 27% [5], which is significantly higher than
      19% a decade ago [6]. Analysts say that increasing the Asian share of the
      student population to 44% may take spots from other minority groups that
      Harvard “favors” (mainly blacks and Hispanics), as well as significantly
      reduce the share of Whites from 37% [7].
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Another important factor to consider is that if universities become
      forbidden from using race in the admissions process the admission criteria
      will be based solely on academic achievement and potential. This way race
      will join other banned nonacademic preferences and non-merit-based
      criteria like legacy status, athletics, and geography. Many argue that
      diversity based on race is superficial and artificial. The merit-based
      admissions would result in a more meaningful diversity, which should be
      valued higher than race-based diversity. Merit-based admissions would make
      it harder for universities to fine-tune the racial makeup of the student
      body, but its result would be more authentic diversity. Of course, pure
      merit-based admissions could result in an over-reliance on test scores and
      grades, which in turn would be detrimental to students from
      non-traditional backgrounds and those who did not have equal opportunities
      to receive schooling. Thus, merit-based admissions should not focus
      exclusively on test scores and grades - achievements outside of school and
      recommendations should be factored in too.

    <Header>The Defendant’s Arguments</Header>
    <Paragraph>
      The most important point in Harvard’s favor is that they do not admit
      students who are unqualified and unprepared for attending Harvard,
      regardless of their background. More than half of the students who apply
      to Harvard every year are qualified. Thus, the admissions process then has
      an opportunity to select the best mix of qualified students. In the
      process, The university considers many factors holistically and race is
      just one of them.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Of course, great caution is required here, as some research showed that
      race-based admissions are not based on empirical research but are “of
      political winds from both inside and outside each institution,” and are
      intended to keep campus peace and attract funds. [4]
    </Paragraph>
    <Quote>
      <p>
        <i>
          The Supreme Court assumes that race-preferential admissions policies
          are the result of a careful academic judgment by colleges and
          universities that racial diversity has pedagogical benefits for
          students generally. But evidence shows that the usual motivation for
          these policies is quite different. In part it is ideological: Such
          policies are an effort to pay a debt for past or present societal
          discrimination—a motivation the Supreme Court has rejected as
          unconstitutional in the past. In part it is practical: Pressure for
          these policies comes from state legislatures, private foundations, the
          federal government, accreditors, and other similar sources. Why
          respond to such pressure? Frequently, that’s where the money is.

    <Paragraph>
      There is not much stopping Harvard and other universities from attributing
      high significance to an applicant’s race, like in the Gratz v. Bollinger
      case [10], where the University of Michigan was found to award 20 percent
      of the minimum points required for admission to African-American,
      Hispanic, and Native American students. This resulted in almost every
      applicant from those races being admitted, while Gratz, a white applicant
      was denied admission. Similarly, in the University of California v. Allan
      Bakke case [14], the special admissions program committee was found to
      over rely on race in an admissions process, leading to unfair conditions
      for some applicants.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      In fairness, Harvard’s admissions attributes less importance to race than
      in the Gratz v. Bollinger case or the University of California case. The
      most similar case would be Grutter v. Bollinger [9], where the use of race
      was tailored because race was merely a "potential 'plus' factor", which is
      similar to how it is used in the Harvard admissions process, as it splits
      focus evenly between students' academic ability, GPA, talents,
      experiences, and potential. Additionally, a personal statement, letters of
      recommendation, and an essay describing how the applicant will contribute
      to school life are all factored into the decision. A more recent precedent
      is the Fisher v. University of Texas case [11], where the use of race was
      narrowly tailored as a means of pursuing greater diversity. The Equal
      Protection Clause does not require universities to be blind to
      discrimination and universities can include race as a factor in admission
      rather than attempt to conceal its role.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Finally, the trial court showed that, despite the plaintiff's claims,
      Harvard does not discriminate against Asian American applicants. What is
      more, it was shown that there are no perfect solutions for achieving a
      diverse student body without factoring in race (proving significant
      financial aid to low-income and first-generation students and other
      race-neutral programs do not work as well) [12].

    <Header>Conclusion</Header>
    <Paragraph>
      Admissions process should focus on selecting qualified candidates first
      and foremost, which is what Harvard is doing. However, since there are way
      more qualified applicants than available positions, additional factors
      should be taken into account. Harvard employs a wide variety of metrics
      and qualities in its decision, one of which is race. Race does not play an
      overwhelming role in the admission decision and thus is constitutionally
      legal (according to the previous precedence). Harvard is interested in
      maintaining a diverse student body as that is beneficial for the students
      and the public perception of the university. At the same time, it must be
      emphasized that the bar for allowing universities to consider race should
      be very strict and universities should be held to a high standard. It
      would be worth revisiting this case again in a decade or two if more
      race-neutral diversity metrics become available.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Thus, I believe that Harvard is justified in keeping race as one of the
      factors of the admissions process, as long as it does not give an
      overwhelming advantage to some groups and does not admit candidates who do
      not have the necessary credentials to succeed in the demanding classes at
      Harvard.
