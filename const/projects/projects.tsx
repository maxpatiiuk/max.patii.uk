/**
 * While this might not be the best way to define posts, here are some
 * benefits:
 *  - Very simple infrastructure (no database required)
 *  - Type safety included (since posts are defined in TypeScript)
 *  - Autocompletion & Grammar checker included (thanks to IDE plugins)
 *  - Easy to search among all posts at once
 *  - All content is version controlled
 *  - Since there aren't too many posts, and they aren't modified often, and
 *    there aren't multiple people editing them, and there aren't multiple
 *    localizations of a post, this is definitelly the simplest way to get the
 *    task done.

              Amazon services have countless automated alarms set up to detect
              any anomalies and widespread outages. During an average day, there
              are about 10 high severity tickets opened every minute. In cases
              of extensive breakdown, that rate increases by many times to the
              point where it becomes impossible to quickly find the root cause
              of the issue. In case of any emergencies, every second counts, and
              it is critical to localize the issue as soon as possible.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              Spacetime is a tool I created during my Amazon Internship in 2022.
              Spacetime aims to reduce how long it takes to troubleshoot an
              Amazon service outage by analyzing the metadata of all high
              severity issues opened in the last few hours to find the most
              affected areas and the scale of the problem. Spacetime makes it
              easy to see insights about the data and quickly filter out the
              irrelevant noise and have the charts update instantaneously.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              There already exists a tool at Amazon, which shows all high
              severity tickets in real-time as a long table, allowing you to
              stay in touch with the latest developments and anomalies. However,
              on an average day, there are about 10 high severity tickets opened
              every minute. And in cases of extensive breakdown, that rate
              increases by many times to the point where it becomes impossible
              to quickly find the root cause of the issue. In case of any
              emergencies, every second counts, and it is critical to localize
              the issue as soon as possible. And that is the main issue
              Spacetime is trying to solve, and I am proud to say itâ€™s quite
              good at that.

              <p>
                I received written permission to display the screenshots you see
                below, under the condition that the screenshots do not include
                real data. I wrote a fake data generator to provide the data for
                the screenshots. Keep in mind that the main benefit of Spacetime
                (how easy it is to spot anomalies), is void when looking at fake
                data.

            <Paragraph>
              The top half of the page is a table of all the issues, with each
              column being sortable and filterable. The bottom half of the page
              aggregates all the data from the table and plots it by different
              dimensions.
            </Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>
              For example, the first chart counts the number of tickets opened
              at any point. The greatest benefit of plotting data like that is
              that even without knowing anything about the data, any anomaly
              would be strikingly visible as a large spike on a line.
            </Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>
              You can select any region in the line chart, and all the charts
              and the table update immediately to only show data from that
              region. Similarly, you could click on one or multiple pie chart
              slices to only include data from those categories.
            </Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>
              All of the filters are cumulative, allowing you to quickly filter
              out large amounts of noise and get down to the real issue.
              Additionally, the URL of the page stays synchronized with any
              filter or sorting conditions you specify. This allows to easily
              copy the URL and send it in a Slack message and email and be
              confident that the other person would see the same data.
            </Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>
              You also have an option of collapsing the table to focus on charts
              or collapsing the charts to see more tickets at once.

              At the top of the page there is a search bar for quickly filtering
              the records. The search highlights matched records in the table.
              However, instead or removing unmatched tickets, it simply grays
              them out. This is super useful for being able to see the context
              arround the search results.
            </Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>
              For more advanced use cases, each table can have advanced filters
              applied. For example, you can add a Regular Expression filter,
              take a union of multiple filters or negate a filter.
            </Paragraph>

              Spacetime respects users preference for light and dark mode and

                As far as use cases, itâ€™s possible that by default our tool
                doesnâ€™t cover your use case as itâ€™s hard to predict your need,
                or the needs may change. Thatâ€™s why we designed it to be very
                customizable You can customize the chart and table layout

                I aimed to make Spacetime relevant for years to come. That is
                why Spacetime allows replacing the underlying data set easily. I
                was able to change Spacetime to work with a completely different
                data set in just 30 minutes. It can be used not just for
                plotting incident data, but for displaying any sort of time
                series data with just minor modifications.
              </li>
              <li>
                Lastly, itâ€™s worth mentioning that Spacetime aims to be WCAG 2.1
                compliant. Itâ€™s an accessibility standard. I wasnâ€™t able to
                achieve full compliance because of non-compliant third-party
                libraries, but I am passionate about accessibility and tried to
                pay attention to it thought the development process.

              What would you do differently if you had to start again?
            </SubHeader>
            <Paragraph>
              I have a habit of reinventing the wheel and writing my own
              solutions even if an existing alternative exists. This leads to
              lots of extra code and common lifting. My teammates helped me
              identify this problem, and pursued me to replace a lot of custom
              code with third-party libraries. If I were to start again, I would
              use the libraries from the beginning, to save the time spent on
              rewriting the code.
            </Paragraph>

            <SubHeader>What was the biggest challenge?</SubHeader>
            <Paragraph>
              I had little prior experience working in a team and having my code
              reviewed. I am used to making lots of code changes and pushing
              them immediately. It was a bit of a struggle at first to adapt to
              the code review process and document the code so that others can
              understand it easily. But, I am happy to say that I am starting to
              get a hang of it and the code review process is going smoother
              now.
            </Paragraph>

            <SubHeader> Can I edit tickets through Spacetime?</SubHeader>
            <Paragraph>
              No that is out of scope. Spacetime is a read-only dashboard for
              quick analysis of the high severity issues in real-time. However,
              Spacetime has links to the Amazon ticketing system where tickets
              can be edited.
            </Paragraph>

            <SubHeader>Why is this tool called Spacetime?</SubHeader>
            <Paragraph>
              In physics, spacetime is a mathematical model that combines the
              three dimensions of space and one dimension of time into a single
              four-dimensional manifold. The project has a lot to do with charts
              (where time is one axis), and you can go back in time to see data
              for the previous hour/day. Thus, a name related to traveling
              through space and time is appropriate.

            <Paragraph>
              Front-end is build on top of Vue.js 3 and provides a modern single
              page application experience. The component-based architecture of
              Vue.js helps with reducing code duplication by allowing developers
              to reuse common logic and interface components.

            <Paragraph>
              Spacetime is using the dc.js charting library for displaying the
              diagrams. dc.js is built on top of d3.js and thus has wonderful
              real-time update support while abstracting away many details to
              make the development process simpler. The only concern with this
              library is the accessibility, as screen reader support leaves more
              to be desired.

            <SubHeader>Back-end</SubHeader>
            <Paragraph>
              During my internship, I focused on front-end features, as those
              would help sell the leadership team on the benefits of Spacetime
              and allow stakeholders to get an idea of the final product.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              That is why, my back-end consisted of AWS S3 bucket, AWS Route53,
              and AWS CloudFront only. The tickets were provided statically. In
              the future, this would be changed to include an AWS DynamoDB and
              AWS Lambda function, that fetches data in real-time.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              This architecture makes the application completely stateless. As a
              direct outcome, the system scales automatically to meet higher
              usage demands and is fault-tolerant thanks to multiple
              availability zones being supported.
            </Paragraph>

            <SubHeader>Cloud diagram</SubHeader>
            <Paragraph>
              The proposed back-end architecture is very simple thanks to the
              usage of Serverless computing. Userâ€™s Web browser contacts the AWS
              Route53 DNS service to resolve the domain address. Once resolved,
              the browser requests static files from an AWS S3 bucket.
              Afterward, the web browser sends requests to the GraphQL API
              managed by AWS AppSync, which in turn forwards the requests to AWS
              Lamda Functions for processing. Lamda Functions fetch data from
              the AWS DynamoDB, aggregate it, and return it to the client while
              logging the entire process using AWS CloudWatch.
            </Paragraph>

            <Paragraph>
              At the same time, a different AWS Lamda Function polls SIM-T for
              newly opened tickets every minute, formats the response according
              to the Configuration file, and stores that in AWS DynamoDB. This
              means the front-end doesnâ€™t have to do extra processing, improving
              the performance, while also ensuring that Spacetime is usable even
              if SIM-T is down.

              Additionally, since Spacetime is meant to feel very responsive, it
              downloads all tickets for a selected date range from the backend
              and does the rest of the filtering on the front-end in response to
              any filter changes you make. This allows charts to update as soon
              as you changed a filter, rather than having to wait for a network
              request to complete.

              Spacetime is designed from the ground up to be highly customizable

              The system gets tickets from the SIM-T system, but beyond that,
              treats data in a completely generic way, without any hardcoded
              assumptions, other than what is specified in the configuration
              file. The configuration file is responsible for determining which
              columns are displayed, in which order, how they are formatted, as
              well as default, sorting, and filtering. Additionally, the charts
              are user-customizable. This design allows to easily adapt the
              system to a different data set or to have multiple views of the
              same dataset.

            <Paragraph>
              I am very passionate about Web Accessibility. It makes worldwide
              information accessible to all, and turns the internet into a a
              friendlier place for humans.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              Accessibility is important not just for people with visible
              disabilities, but for every one of us. For example, adding
              keyboard navigation support, increasing the size of clickable
              elements, adding extra whitespace, increasing contrast, and adding
              touch-screen support are the kind of things that would benefit
              everyone.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              Additionally, all accessibility improvements bring new features to
              regular users. For example, I am a big fan of using screen
              readers, not because I have to, but because I like to. I am often
              too lazy to read a long article, so I just let the screen reader
              do that for me.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              For this and many other reasons, I put accessibility compliance as
              one of the top priorities when planning the next release of
              Specify 7 (a scientific collection management software).

            <Paragraph>
              One of the most challenging parts of the accessibility refactor
              was the tree viewer. The tree viewer should look like a table to a
              sighted user but be announced as a tree to a screen reader user.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              At the same time, every tree node should be expandable and
              selectable, and keyboard navigation must allow navigating not just
              between tree nodes, but also moving quickly to the toolbar in the
              header and back.
            </Paragraph>
            <List caption="These issues were solved in the following ways">
              <li>
                The tree is rendered out of "&lt;ul&gt;" and "&lt;gt&gt;"
                elements with "role" of "tree", "treeitem", and "group". This
                helps accessible technology recognize the layout as a tree and
                announce it properly. At the same time, these elements are
                styled as a grid, to mimic a table layout. This ensures all
                cells in the same column have the same width
              </li>
              <li>
                Each tree node is a button that has the "aria-describedby"
                attribute pointing to the column header. Each node also has
                expand/contract icons which were given corresponding
                "aria-label" attributes
              </li>
              <li>
                The focused tree node has an outline. Keyboard arrows allow
                navigating between tree nodes. Enter key expands/collapses the
                current tree node
              </li>
              <li>
                The "Shift+Tab" key combination can be used to move focus to the
                toolbar with context-aware buttons. Afterward, the "Tab" key can
                be pressed to return the focus to the last focused tree node

              The Test Panel is used to easily test different versions of the

            <Header>Automatic deployments</Header>
            <Paragraph>
              A GitHub Webhook has been configured for the Specify 7 repository
              which pings the test panel to check if some bug is ready to be
              tested.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              A ready-to-be-tested bug is defined as a branch in the Specify 7
              repository, for which all automated tests have passed, and which
              has an associated pull request that has been assigned for review
              to the QA team (or a member of the team), and has not yet been
              reviewed. If a pull request has been assigned for review both to a
              member of the development team and a member of the QA team, the
              test panel deploys the branch only after the developer has
              approved the pull request, so as not to waste the QA team's time
              testing code that may be rejected.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              If a maximum number of deployments has already been reached
              (defined in the config file), the test panel tries to destroy old
              deployments that haven't been accessed recently.
            </Paragraph>
            <Image source={testPanel1}>Automatic deployments</Image>

            <Header>Custom deployments</Header>
            <Paragraph>
              Besides the automated deployments, there is often a need to test a
              specific branch (e.i. production) in a specific database to
              replicate a bug or get everything ready for a release.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              For these purposes, any deployment can have its configuration
              changed. Each deployment has an associated DockerHub tag (created
              from a HEAD of a GitHub branche), a database, and a data model
              version

            <Header>Database Management</Header>
            <Paragraph>
              Besides all deployments running in Docker, the test panel itself
              is Dockerized. Docker composition comes with a MariaDB server to
              provide databases for deployments.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              The dashboard provides a list of databases, a list of users in
              each database (needed for authentication into a Specify 7
              instance), and an ability to upload a new database, download an
              existing one, or drop it.

            <Paragraph>
              For security purposes, the test panel is protected behind a GitHub
              OAuth authentication, which only permits signing it with accounts
              that are members of the{' '}

            <Paragraph>
              I am not a designer, but I like building user interfaces that look
              awesome while being easy to use. The best interface makes the user
              feel powerful, without overwhelming them.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              That is why I decided to refactor the entire user interface of
              Specify 7, a collection management software, to be more
              user-friendly and pleasurable to use.
            </Paragraph>
            <List caption="List of most important changes">
              <li>
                The styling has been completely rewritten to make it feel modern
                and consistent. Great attention was paid to focusing the user's
                attention on the most important actions, through clever use of
                color, position, and size
              </li>
              <li>
                Tailwind CSS library has been added to handle all the styling
                needs. It makes styling things easier and helps keep everything
                consistent between the pages
              </li>
              <li>
                Modal dialogs are some of the most important parts of Specify 7
                interface. They are used all over the place, from simple
                confirmation messages to complicated forms and elaborate grids.
                Thus, lots of thought was put into every detail. We debated the
                use of color in dialog buttons, the presence of an icon in the
                top corner, and the gentle gradient in the top right corner
              </li>
              <li>
                As part of our accessibility commitment and changes to become
                compliant with the WCAG 2.1 accessibility standard, ancient
                jQuery date pickers, sliders and modals were replaced with
                modern native components. Native components come with keyboard
                accessibility and screen reader support baked in, simplifying
                the development and keeping the user happy

        content: (

            <Paragraph>
              Public APIs must be stable and reliable, yet manual testing is
              often not practical due to time constraints. Thankfully, the
              OpenAPI schema allows to define endpoints, and describe their
              input parameters as well as the response schema in a
              machine-readable way.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              This schema can then be used to validate incoming requests on the
              fly, as well as to provide continuous testing.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              The OpenAPI testing framework I developed can run automated tests
              on all endpoints by randomly creating a valid query string and
              comparing the response object against the schema.
            </Paragraph>
            <Image source={openApi1}>Example automated tests</Image>
            <Paragraph>
              While automated tests are an awesome low-effort solution,
              sometimes you need to provide specific test values and define
              expected constraints (how a given parameter should affect the
              output). This use case is also handled by the library.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              Additionally, some tests may require running a particular sequence
              of operations (for example, Create, View, Edit, View, Delete).
              This can be solved through Chain tests, where the testing
              framework would run the output of one request through a generator
              to produce the input for the next request and so on.

            <Paragraph>
              By default, the testing framework runs tests on all endpoints,
              prints any issues, and exits once done. For the purposes of
              continuous integration, it may be desirable to continuously run
              periodic tests, results of which are logged and failures are
              reported. My coworker developed a testing daemon and a scheduler
              just for that -{' '}

              This project was done as part of EECS 448 class at the University

              code with sufficient documentation for another team of 5 students

              While a traditional Battleship game would require some sort of
              multiplayer support to coordinate the game state between two
              players, we chose a simpler, and ultimately more intimate
              approach. Two players are supposed to open the game on separate
              computers. When any player makes a move, they are supposed to ask
              the opposite if it was a hit or miss and press the corresponding
              button in the game when promoted.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              Essentially, the state of the game is synchronized through verbal
              communication between the players, which is intended to make the
              game feel more personal and meaningful.
