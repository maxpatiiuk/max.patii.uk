        They already had the code for making Specify&nbsp;7 ping our server on
        startup with telemetry information and storing that in a giant text
        file, but no way to visualize the data.

        In parallel with this project, I was tasked with modernizing an existing
        usage stats visualizer for a separate application.

      <Header>Reflecting on the project</Header>
      <Paragraph>
        When I started this project, I used the technologies I knew best. Among
        the only new things I had to learn was Chart.js and how to work with
        GitHub APIs. This made the development go very quick and I had a working
        prototype within a day.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        At the time, that was an effective approach as that way I was able to
        quickly show results to my team and impress them with, what I though at
        the time, advanced skills.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        However, reflecting on this 4 years later, if I were to do this project
        again, I would instead adopt an existing solution for visualizing stats,
        as there are a lot of fabulous options out there (Google Analytics,
        Mixpanel, Amplitude, Tableau and many others).
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Usage stats visualization is a problem that has been solved a thousand
        times before, and so there was little business value for the company to
        solve it again, beyond the fact that as a undergraduate student
        employee, my salary didn't cost the company much, while my enthusiasm
        was boundless ðŸ˜Š.
